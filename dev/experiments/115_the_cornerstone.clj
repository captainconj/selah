  "Experiment 115: The Cornerstone.

   The stone the builders rejected became the head of the corner.
   This image runs through the entire Bible like a vein of gold.

   Four passages. Four angles on one stone:

   1. Psalm 118:22-29  — The rejected stone. David's psalm. The gate of YHWH.
   2. Isaiah 28:14-22  — The tested stone. The precious cornerstone. The sure foundation.
   3. Daniel 2:31-45   — The stone cut without hands. Shatters the statue. Becomes a mountain.
   4. Zechariah 4:1-10  — The capstone. 'Grace, grace to it!'

   The words to observe:
   - אבן (stone) = א + בן = father + son. GV=53 = garden (גן).
   - פנה (corner) shares root with פנים (face) = ghost zone (22 illum, 0 readings).
   - ראש פנה (head of the corner) — the cornerstone's title.
   - חן (grace) = what the builders shout. חסד = ghost zone (GV=72).
   - מאס (reject) — what the builders do. What does the breastplate do?

   From experiments 112-114, we already know:
   - Stone (אבן) is a fixed point — all four readers agree.
   - Stone = garden = 53 = Fibonacci staircase sum.
   - King = invisible (0/0). Face = ghost zone (22/0).
   - Grace (חסד) GV=72 = the breastplate cannot name itself.

   כי נא — because, please."
